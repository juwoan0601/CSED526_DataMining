Trend Analysis of Medical Robotics 

(The Term Project of CSED526 Data Mining)

# Project Objective
Our project is centered around the creation of a dynamic and informative graph, which will include three essential axes: time, geography, and the medical field. This graph aims to chart the evolving landscape of research activities in the Medical Robotics domain across various time periods, geographical regions, and sub-fields within the medical industry. 
The visualization will serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders, aiding them in tracking and comprehending global research trends and their evolving impact over time. Ultimately, this will enhance strategic decision-making within the healthcare and technology sectors. Medical robotics was chosen due to its transformative potential in healthcare, its capacity to drive innovation, and the necessity for comprehensive trend analysis in this ever-evolving field. Understanding the dynamics and emerging trends is vital for healthcare institutions, investors, and innovators to make informed decisions and investments in this promising sector, contributing to the advancement of healthcare and technology industries.
Data
For our research in the field of medical robotics, we will collect data from academic papers, including author affiliations, keywords, journal field, publication date, and abstract and introduction content. While most data will be extracted from paper manuscripts, the publisher field data will be sourced from Journal Citation Reports (JCR) category labels to ensure accuracy and consistency. This comprehensive data set will serve as the foundation for our robust trend analysis in the field of medical robotics. Keywords in the form of a word set will be integrated with the abstract and introduction context represented as word vectors. This combination will provide a comprehensive representation of the paperâ€™s content, facilitating more effective analysis. Data will be formatted as:
